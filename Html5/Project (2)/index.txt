
    Never Give Up
  
    Never let go, go, go! 
Never give up, up, up!<br>
Never let go, never give up!
You can reach your end goal<br>
Never let go, go, go!
Never give up, up, up!<br>
Never let go, never give up!
You let go, you asshole!<br>
  
      Headfirst for Halos
    
      Let's go back to the middle of the day that starts it all<br>
      I can't begin to let you know just what I'm feeling<br>
      And now, the red ones make me fly<br>
      And the blue ones help me fall<br>
      And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling<br>
